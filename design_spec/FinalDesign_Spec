\clearpage\section{General}
This Design Specification for Goofy Lights Editor outlines program functions that have been added up to now. The sub-teams decided in Week Three have remained approximately the same through out the course of this project. However some of the teams compartmentalized further as the individuals worked on their own areas of the sub-projects.  


\bigskip
\subsection{Timeline}
This timeline is a rough estimate for the future development of the Goofy Lights Editor Project for the Goofy Glasses.\ The timeline has changed over the course  of the semester.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Week One (3/6 - 3/14) - Complete rough draft of Design Specification. 
\item
Week Two (3/14 - 3/21) - Spring Break 
\item
Week Three (3/21 - 3/28) - Initial Development (First Sprint): Sections of the editor were divided amongst team members. The sections were divided into: User Interface Shell - Max and Tim, File Save/load - Garret and Wyatt, Grid - Homaja and Sam, State changer - Hanna and Josh.
\item
Week Four (3/28 - 4/4) - Continued Development (Second Sprint): Each sub-team continues developing their individual section. Start Working on the whole of the user interface. Keep documentation up to date.
\item
Week Five (4/4 - 4/11) - Continued Development: Complete build-in user interface using Qt by bringing all of the pieces together.
\item
Week Six (4/11 - 4/18) - Continued Development: Continue working on the basic functions and add in extra developments, such as; color wheel, updated user interface,  etc...
\item
Week Seven 4/18 - 4/25) - Continued Development: Continue working on the functions from week six. Work on individual bugs in the program.
\item
Week Eight (4/25 - 5/2) - Continued Development: Presentation to class and continue working out bugs and small errors. 
\item
Week Nine (5/2 - 5/9) - Finish Development: Complete all changes to the project, bring documentation up to date and turn in finished project.


\end{itemize}


 \clearpage\section{File Management} 
        \subsection{Saving} 
        
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item Grid configurations can be able to be saved locally so they don't have to be recreated every time.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Entire animations can be able to be saved locally.
            \end{itemize}
            
        \subsection{Loading} 
        
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item Audio files will be able to be loaded in so that they can be paired up with the animation.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Previously saved animations can be able to be loaded, overwriting the current animation project. A dialog box will
                	appear to warn the user that they will be overwriting the current animation project.
        	\end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Grid configurations can be loaded to overwrite a single frame in an animation. This will help prevent re-creation
                	of frequently used grid configurations.
        	\end{itemize}
            
        \subsection{Auto-save}
        	\begin{itemize}
            	\item One file will be kept during the program's operation that will be \newline continuously overridden once every 
                	five minutes. It will automatically save out the entire animation that is currently being worked on.
            \end{itemize}
 
 
\clearpage
\section{Goto State}
The user will be able to move to any state.
\subsection{Move Slider}
Will set slider to go to any state at that particular point of time. The slider maximum time will be set to the total time it takes for all the frames.
\subsection{State time}
Will give option for the user to select how long the state should play. If user doesn?t provide any value, then the default time the state stays would be set to 1 second.
\section{Dimensions}
This section contains dimensions for grid and tower.
\subsection{Main Grid}
The main grid default dimensions are set to 10*20. User also has a provision to set the dimensions of the main grid area and set the cell color of the grid. Default color is set to gray.
\subsection{Tower Grid}
The tower grid default dimensions are set to 4*10. The tower grid is shown with black borders inside the main grid. User can select the tower grid size and can specify the start and end rows, columns of the tower grid. The frames color will be updated only if the color is chosen inside this tower grid.
 
 	\clearpage\section{Show Preview}
        The Show Preview will allow the user to run the animation they've created in an emulator, which will give them an accurate representation of what their show will look like when played on the grid.
	\subsection{Example}
	 

	
	\subsection{Functionality}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Show the Preview in the main window
		\begin{itemize}
		    \item The "Play/Pause" button starts the playback in the main grid area.
		\end{itemize}
				\item Move Tiles
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The layout of directional controls allows the user to shift the main grid. Up, down, left and right, as well as diagonals are included in these shift buttons.
				\end{itemize}
			\item Manage Preview Playback
		 \begin{itemize}
		     \item Play\textbackslash Pause: Used to start and pause the preview playback. This button changes from "Play\textbackslash Pause" to "Pause" as the animation starts and to "Resume" if the animation is paused. The button will reset to its original title when the playback has finished or the Stop button is used. 
		       \item Stop : The Stop button stops the preview playback and resets the timer to zero.
		       \item Adjust playback speed : Both a SpinBox and a ComboBox can be used to adjust the speed of the playback. The SpinBox allows the user more control while the ComboBox can be quicker for basic use. The ComboBox playback speed presets are: 0.25x, 0.5x 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, default is 1x speed for both adjusters.
		       \item Quit : Allows the user to exit the program
		       \item Add Frame : The user can add individual frames anywhere in the show.
		       \item Delete Frame : Lets the user delete frames also from anywhere in the timeline.
		 \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

 \clearpage\section{Stamps}
	The stamps function will allow the user to access previously saved images in a quick manner. 
	
	\subsection{Functionality}
	When clicking on the "stamps" icon, a box will pop up with different previously saved stamps. The user will then click on one and it will be added to the current frame. Preset stamps include:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Shapes
        \item Letters
        \item Numbers
      \end{itemize}
   \subsection{Creating Stamps}
   The user will also be able to add stamps to the program. A "save as stamp" option will be added to the tool bar. This allows for the current frame to be added to the stamp feature.
	\fi
	
	
	  \clearpage\section{Mass Editing}
    The user will be able to select multiple frames of an animation.
        \subsection{Copy}
        The user will be able to save a grouping of frames to a local clipboard, saved until the program is closed or a new set of frames is copied.
        \subsection{Paste}
        The user will be able to insert the copied frames before or after a selected frame. They will be able to do this with the same set of copied frames, until they copy a new set of frames or close the program.
        \subsection{Insert}
        The user will be able to insert frames before or after a selected frame. They may do this as many times as desired, within reasonable limitations, and will always insert a copy of the selected frame immediately before or immediately after the selected frame.
	
	
	\iffalse
    \clearpage\section{Audio Integration}
    The user will be able to import audio files for playback and time-line length creation
        \subsection{Playback}
        The user will be able the have the audio file play at the same time as a preview of their animation to give an accurate representation of the final output
        \subsection{Time-line Length}
        The user will be able to use the duration of the audio file to create an accurate working length for creating their animation 
 \fi
 
 
\clearpage\section{Color Editor}
The user can also select from an preset selection of common colors  and assign it to a cell. He will also be able to  select any color from the a color wheel.
\subsection{Color Selection}
There will be two modes of color selection: the color wheel, and a list of color presets.
\subsubsection{Color Dialog}
The user will interact with a color picker. This picker will have many features to help with customization, such as a box to slide the color selection around in.
\subsubsection{Color Presets} 
There will be a list of twelve preset colors. The user can click these squares to automatically assign a color.
\subsection{Assigning Color}
The user will be able to assign color to a square in the current state by left clicking the square with their mouse. If no color is assigned to a square, the default will be no color.

\clearpage\section{Additional Features}

\subsection{Add-Ons to File Saving} A parser and IO system for the file saving will be added at a later time.
\subsection{Preview Slider} The Preview window will have a "preview area" that shows the timeline of the current show. The preview area will also have a slider which can be dragged back and forth along the timeline to view the preview playback.
\iffalse
 \subsection {Sync with Audio}
			 A simple checkbox to indicate whether the playback will start the designated audio track when the preview playback is started. 

\subsection{Paint Brush Coloring}
The user will be able to hold left click and drag their mouse over squares. This will paint all the squares it touches. The user can also hold right click to erase the squares.
\fi
\subsection{Assigning Personal Presets}
