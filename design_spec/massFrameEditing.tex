% Mass select, copy/paste, insertion of frames

\documentclass[12pt]{article}


\begin{document}
    \section{Mass Editing}
    The user will be able to select multiple frames of an animation.
        \subsection{Copy}
        The user will be able to save a grouping of frames to a local clipboard, saved until the program is closed or a new set of frames is copied.
        \subsection{Paste}
        The user will be able to insert the copied frames before or after a selected frame. They will be able to do this with the same set of copied frames, until they copy a new set of frames or close the program.
        \subsection{Insert}
        The user will be able to insert frames before or after a selected frame. They may do this as many times as desired, within reasonable limitations, and will always insert a copy of the selected frame immediately before or immediately after the selected frame.
