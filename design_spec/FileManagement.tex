        \subsection{Saving} 
        
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item Grid configurations will be able to be saved locally so they don't have to be recreated every time.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Entire animations will be able to be saved locally.
            \end{itemize}
            
        \subsection{Loading} 
        
        	\begin{itemize}
        		\item Audio files will be able to be loaded in so that they can be paired up with the animation.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Previously saved animations will be able to be loaded, overwriting the current animation project. A dialog box will
                	appear to warn the user that they will be overwriting the current animation project.
        	\end{itemize}
            
            \begin{itemize}
        		\item Grid configurations can be loaded to overwrite a single frame in an animation. This will help prevent re-creation
                	of frequently used grid configurations.
        	\end{itemize}
            
        \subsection{Auto-save}
        	\begin{itemize}
            	\item One file will be kept during the program's operation that will be \newline continuously overridden once every 
                	five minutes. It will automatically save out the entire animation that is currently being worked on.
            \end{itemize}
