 \underline {UI shell - Max and Tim}\\
	Uploaded the template for the rest of the teams to work from. The UI shell consisted of blank spaces to be fitted later with the other teams's individual pieces. \\ A space for elements that we haven't started were also included, such as a space for a color wheel and components to ajust the playtime and duration of the show.
