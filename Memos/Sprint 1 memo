\subsubsection*{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{Overview}

\begin{description}
\item
 \underline {UI shell - Max and Tim}\\
	Uploaded the template for the rest of the teams to work from. 
	The UI shell consisted of blank spaces to be fitted later with the other teams's individual pieces. 
	\\ A space for elements that we haven't started were also included, such as a space for a color wheel 
	and components to adjust the playtime and duration of the show.
\item
 \underline {File Save/load - Garret and Wyatt}\\
 	Added file browsers to the Load, Save as, and Export buttons that save the path selected into a string for use in opening,
	saving, and exporting projects. A parser and file IO system will be added later.
 \item
\underline {Grid - Homaja and Sam}\\
	We were primarily incharge of creating the frame and the class for the individual cells. Homaja added the default color and preffered size for each of the cell
	while Sam made the basic framework. The frame is at a basic state which does not support frames but this will be added at a later
	date.
 \item
\underline {State changer - Hanna and Josh}\\
