{\bf Subject} Sprint 1

{\bf Date} March 30, 2017

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
	This was the first sprint of our development. We strove to build a basic prototype and learn Qt. We broke into groups of two.

\subsubsection*{Overview}

\begin{description}
\item
 \underline {UI shell - Max and Tim}\\
	Uploaded the template for the rest of the teams to work from. 
	The UI shell consisted of blank spaces to be fitted later with the other teams's individual pieces. 
	\\ A space for elements that we haven't started were also included, such as a space for a color wheel 
	and components to adjust the playtime and duration of the show.
\item
 \underline {File Save/load - Garret and Wyatt}\\
 	Added file browsers to the Load, Save as, and Export buttons that save the path selected into a string for use in opening,
	saving, and exporting projects. A parser and file IO system will be added later.
 \item
\underline {Grid - Homaja and Sam}\\
	We were primarily incharge of creating the frame and the class for the individual cells. Homaja added the default color and preffered size for each of the cell
	while Sam made the basic framework. The frame is at a basic state which does not support frames but this will be added at a later
	date.
 \item
\underline {State changer - Hanna and Josh}\\
	We were in charge of creating a list of frames on the back end. This allows users to create states and save them to the end of the animation. It also allows them to remove the last made animation and update the current grid shown.
 \item
\underline{Bits and Pieces}\\
	Near the end of the sprint, we added a few features. These features were: assigning a selected color to a cell; selecting different colors; and rudimentary file saving. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Summary}
	In the end, we built an almost complete prototype except for loading from a file. We setup a place to collect Qt tutorials that proved immensely useful during development.
